She is 9 and she has been on a steady incline of weight for the last three years (when her parents divorced) Its because her mother takes them out for fast food for every meal, she says she has no time to cook. We eat very healthy at our house but we cant battle all fast food all the time for half of the month. Its really bad when they will call and their dad asks \"what did you have for dinner\" and she will say \"we went to Sonic and I had cheddar bites, the coating off of onion rings and a pop\" or she will say that she had a mcdonalds meal (Adult size meal, not a kids meal) and that wasnt enough so she ate her sister<APO>s leftovers from the mongolian bbq place! Or they ate popcorn at home for breakfast because their cereal was stale, but then they went to mcdonalds so she ate again. We have talked to her about nutrition, portion control, and told her that we cant control where they eat when she is at moms, but she can make healthier choices when eating. But it doesnt change! and when we talk to his ex she gets defensive and wont hear it. Im scared for her future, and her health, but what do we do?"

My 3 step-children are with us nearly full time now, but in the past we were in the same situation. My step-children are all slender, but that was sort of part of the problem. I think that there is a perception that skinny = healthy. And that is simply not so! Just because the poor food choices have not caught up with their weight yet doesn<APO>t mean it won<APO>t, and their teeth and development depends on a healthy, balanced diet. We approached it like you are. We made out home healthy and balanced. It was kind of a drag, because we couldn<APO>t have treats and desserts as often, because they would have pop-tarts or (seriously) candy for breakfast at their mom<APO>s, so desserts or anything like that was off the table for us, because we felt like we had to load them up on lean protein, whole grains, low fat dairy and fruits and veggies when we had them. I wish you luck in figuring this out. It is so important to be dillegent when they are young to teach them good habits for when they get older. I hope others will have actual advice for you, since all I can say is that I totally understand your frustration, and I feel for you!"

Same thing with her grandparents house, my father in law caught me in the mall one day and was telling me he just found out how different she eats at our house from their house and he is at least trying to help. I remember going over there for dinner once and she ate more food than I did, I finally had to take her plate from her because she kept going back, and not 10 minutes later she asked for a muffin and when when her dad said no she pouted then went to complain to grandma about it!

I don<APO>t see how she can be successful unless you get mom on board. 9 is a very young age to be making independant choices against what her mother expects of her. Can you go, or your husband go, to a pediatrician<APO>s appointment? kind of hard to say they are wrong, and that may help convince her. Or talk to a nurse at her school if they have one. My last comment may be kind of offensive, but I don<APO>t mean it to be, so forgive me. I think they still have camps for kids with weight problems. That way she could learn how to eat better away from mom, and meet other kids with the same issues. Then she may be able to be more sucessful, even if mom still doesn<APO>t want to hear it. I started gaining my weight at about the same age, and at my biggest (adult) weight I was over 300 lbs, so if she can start improving now, that would be good. I wish you the best of luck!"

Even for my step daughter she is a big girl (not fat,) she was healthy looking, but not over weight, she is tall for her age and so is my daughter. They get it from their father who is 6<APO>1. We would get into arguments with my step daughters mother about not just diet but how she was raising her period. Some adults just need to let bygones be bygones and move on with their lives and make the best of what we have.

Add trying to keep consistency between households, and wow. I think a vist with your pediatrician with both mom and dad may be the way to start. Both households need to be on board and understand the future health risks as well as how this is affecting the child now. This could be a chance to explore what the barriers are that are getting in the way of healthy eating and activity. Identifying the barriers (time, lack of resources, lack of awareness) and then brainstorming ways to overcome them could be the next step."

I hate to admit this, but my children notice I cannot go one day without my can of Dr. Pepper or Coca-Cola.

40,13,"Dr. Tiongson, I have a question about BMI","Christopher Tiongson, MD","2011-02-21 22:08:08","<ORG>","Youare correct. It is a percentile-based measurement. The pattern for a kid BMI is like a wave through childhood. Toddlers are natually a bit heavier relative to their height and have a bit less muscle mass relative to their weight. As kids become preschoolers they start to slim down. As children approach puberty both the boys and girls start to add muscle mass (which is a healthy increase in BMI) and the girls start go through their body changes, the BMI goes up again. This change over time means that we have to follow percentiles to track whether the height and weight are a healthy match. For example, 50%ile for a 2 yr old girl is a BMI of 16.4. By age 3 the 50%ile drops to 15.8 And by age 15 it is 20. It<APO>s easier to follow on the graph. Here<APO>s the BMI chart for girls http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/data/set1clinical/cj41c024.pdf Here it is for boys http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/data/set1clinical/cj41c021.pdf And to top it all off, BMI is not just a simple ratio of weight to height. It is actually weight per body surface area (which is related to height.) So while a 90%ile height and 90%ile weight would seem to be exactly proportional (i.e. 50%ile BMI) the numbers don<APO>t come out that way. It would be more like 85-90%ile BMI."

My daughter is 5-years-old and is OBSESSED with her weight. She is not stick-skinny like the girls in her class, but her doctor is not concerned with her weight (we have discussed weight with her doctor throughout the years). The taller she gets the more she thins out She eats healthy meals, has healthy snacks (yogurt, grapes, oranges, etc.) and is active (she loves wii fit for kids, takes ballet classes and is usually running around). A boy in her Pre-K class called her fat several weeks ago, and now she is obsessed with her weight and food. She walks around sucking her stomach in so her ribs stick out, then cries when we tell her to be herself. She asks me on a daily basis (several times a day) if she<APO>s losing weight, or if her \"tummy is smaller.\" If the TV is on she<APO>ll make comments like, \"that girl is fat so she doesn<APO>t eat healthy\" or \"I want to look like that girl\" (these are not weight-concious shows - this happens just when watching commercials). She<APO>ll even stop eating halfway through a meal and say, \"I can<APO>t eat anymore or I<APO>ll get fatter.\" I am okay with being health-concious. We eat family meals and encourage physical activities in our home. We tell our kids that healthy foods are necessary fuel for our bodies. But my 11-year-old daughter hasn<APO>t even gone through this obsession with weight. My 5-year-old is a very happy little girl, except when it comes to the weight topic. I<APO>m concerned and her near-hysterics when trying to talk about it are breaking my heart. Thank you in advance."

In general, it is best to keep the focus on healthy eating and activity. It sounds like you are already doing a great job of emphasizing healthy habits. Physical fitness, basically how well your child<APO>s body works as she plays and learns (for exampler her energy level, endurance, strength) and not size is key. Combatting the media<APO>s and society<APO>s biases about physical appearance is not easy. Offering counter-examples of healthy (and realistic) body types might be something to try if she is a fairly mature 5-yr-old. Also maybe showing the graph of BMIs on the growth chart to your daughter might allow you to show her that she is tracking along just fine and that she is in the healthy range. I think this sounds like something that should be explored in depth with your pediatrician or a counselor. It is interesting that her distress seems to be isolated to body image."

Yes, Haylen, it is heartbreaking to watch children at such young ages go through this. I appreciate you sharing your story so I know that I<APO>m not the only parent that has had such a young child be concerned with this. My daughter was oblivious to weight on anyone until this comment was made by the boy in her class. Thanks, Dr. Tiongson, for the great ideas. My daughter is very curious by nature, so she is not letting this weight thing go. She disects every piece of food we put in front of her - asking what<APO>s healthy, and if it<APO>s not healthy, she asks why it<APO>s not. We also keep telling her that treats are okay - in moderation (but we<APO>ve found many treats that are quite healthy - mainly fruit-based). I like that she<APO>s curious and wants to learn, and she is accepting our \"all things in moderation\" policy.

Before getting in to speak with our daughter<APO>s physician about her obsession with her weight, she caught the flu bug that was going around....or so we thought. She had some vomitting and complained of stomach pains, but she had an ongoing fever that would come for a few days, then go away, then come back. We couldn<APO>t get her to eat and she was sleeping all the time. DH took her to see the physician for her fever, fatigue and stomach pains - they did a urine analysis, strep culture, blood work for mono & a stomach x-ray. It turns out she was severly constipated (I believe due to her sudden diet changes) - so much so that it was causing the fever (usually around 102.5), fatigue and stomach pains. She is now on Mirolax for 2 months and limited to 1-2 cups of dairy per day. She has been feeling better since DH took her to the doctor - I saw her run last week for the first time in a month and I almost cried with relief. This past weekend she started talking about exercising again, but I will say she has been better about the food aspect of her \"diet.\" They are doing a \"Keep Moving\" unit at school right now, so I think that is contributing to her exercise talk. She did lose weight throughout this ordeal, due to her weight obsession and then her illness, but is still at a healthy weight. We are going to keep working with her and the physician (who told us to call any time - they were also concerned) to make sure she stays healthy, but I have to say this has been one of the most trying things I<APO>ve gone through as a parent."

The most difficult part of losing weight can be finding what you like to eat that fits in a plan, and it does take a lot of research.

They were very sensitive to how I was feeling about everything, and once I started surfing and getting into life with one arm, they helped me figure out how to do things with one arm ? brainstorming and coming up with ideas (like the handle on my surfboard to help me duck-dive - which is a really cool scene in the movie).

DH<APO>s entire family on both sides is severely obese, and my dad<APO>s side of my family has a mild problem with obesity as well. As adults, DH and I now live busy lifestyles, exercise regularly, and eat well. I am now 125lbs and 5<APO>3\", and DH is heavier (maybe 265lbs and 6<APO>2\") but a bulky, muscular build...not fat. So naturally when we started to have children we swore they would never face the challenges we did as far as being overweight. We are very careful to teach him about \"sometimes foods\" such as french fries, \"foods that give you big muscles\" such as broccoli and lean proteins, and \"fill you up foods\" such as pasta and bread. He understands these concepts pretty well and at age 2 he will eat a great variety of foods, and he prefers fruits and vegetables to sweets and junk. My concern is that DS is a BEANPOLE! He is in a high percentile for height, but right at about 50th percentile for weight. His pedi didn<APO>t act worried about his weight, but did note that he could stand to gain a bit and suggested we continue to give him whole milk. We have started to incorporate more red meats into our meals, but we really like to stick to lean proteins and vegetables, fruits, whole grains, etc. I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions...including the expert on the board...of ways we can help our son gain a bit of weight while maintaining a healthy perspective on food and nutrition. I have read and talked to parents of kids who needed to gain weight, and they have been told to let the kids dip their foods in ranch dressing, drink shakes, add cheese to everything, and basically pump them with junk. I<APO>m just not comfortable with that idea and don<APO>t want my child insisting on having ranch to dip his food in because that<APO>s what he had for a period of time while he was needing to gain weight.

A couple of months ago I considered sending my 3 yr old dd to a gymnastics class once a week. We trialed one, and while I liked the program, I did not sign her up. One reason was the kids seemed to stand in line for as much time as they spent being active. Two was the drive from our home was considerable. Three was that all the parents were sitting in the lobby, staring at their kids, not talking at all. So I figured, maybe it would be better worth my time (and money) to take her to a local park and encourage her to be active by playing games that I played as a child, that way I can get in some activity too."

She<APO>s been dancing for about 10 yrs now and as a 9th grader this fall she will be on the high school JV dance team. My son was in a preschool gymnastics class, just to get him moving. He enjoyed the jumping and tumbling, but has moved on to other sports. For my son it was just some active playtime, but my daughter was introduced to her life<APO>s passion. She wants to open a dance studio and teach dance to kids after she graduates from college. She has plans to minor in dance and major in business. It<APO>s funny to think that it all started with that one dance class. So, yeah, I can see it both ways.

Parents have had way more practice having the birds and the bees talk. It is a rite of passage for both the parents and the kids. In the office, I will just break the ice by asking the 11 yr old if he or she has had the \"sex talk\" with mom and dad yet. I either get the knowing nod from kid and parent, or the nervous \"no\" and then mom says \"I guess we should, huh?\" Talking about sex should be inherently more anxiety provoking, but it isn<APO>t. Why is that? I think it stems from the fact that there is a cultural narrative, even a mythology, about the sex talk. Movies and TV have etched it into our culture. And we<APO>ve all been through it ourselves as kids. I<APO>m sure we all remember when our mom or dad sat us down. I do. Vividly. My dad is a physician and \"the talk\" came complete with medical school level anatomic sketches on a napkin. When my mom walked by the kitchen table, she glanced down at the sketches, said \"hmm\" knowingly and marched on. There is no such blueprint culturally or from personal experience for many parents to fall back on for the weight talk. Even though the sex talk will be clumsy, that<APO>s ok because both the kid and parent know it is coming (sometime) and they both expect it to be just a bit awkward. So what can parents do to start the conversation about weight? Have your pediatrician broach the subject during a well child visit. Just like how I bluntly ask about if you<APO>ve had the sex talk yet, your pediatrician can say \"have you talked with your mom or dad about healthy eating and staying active to improve your health?\" Or initiate the conversation in the doctor<APO>s office yourself. After looking at the growth chart with your doctor, ask \"Is there something we can do as a family to improve our nurtrition and physical activity?\" Try to keep the focus on preventing health complications, not on appearance. With the focus on the family as a whole this can help keep the child from feeling singled out under a spotlight of criticism. Start the conversation at home, similarly to above, keeping the focus on how the whole family can work to improve healthy eating and activity. Ask the child what he or she thinks might be a good first step. Bottom line: plan it out, keep the focus on the family and on health, and go for it.

I grew up in a home where healthy eating and lifestyle was just how we did it. No junk food, no processed foods, lots of exercise. My parents modeled it and we knew nothing else. However, when I hit puberty early, my mother became concerned about the curves I was developing and started putting me on strict diets and hiding foods from me. All that did was make me a secret (and shamed) eater. I went on to have weight issues to this day though I<APO>ve at least left the yo-yo dieting behind me, and here I am at 50 working again to lose some weight brought on by a health condition and medication. Because of the above, I took a different approach when raising my own sons but I probably wasn<APO>t as strict as I should have been. While one of my sons was always slim and remains so now with healthy eating and lots of exercise, my younger son struggled with weight just like me. At 25 now, he<APO>s lost 90 pounds through a long effort of exercise and changing his eating. I<APO>m so proud of his commitment. We did talk about weight, food choices, exercise, throughout their lives, but in my determination not to be as rabid about it as my own mother, I may have been more lax than I should have been. Now I see my granddaughter at almost 4 years old. She has two slim parents and they eat VERY healthy, largely due to her mother having Diabetes Type 1 and celiac, and her father being lactose intolerant and having other food allergies. So they don<APO>t eat processed foods, everything is home prepared cooked and very healthy. And my granddaughter is a happy and active little girl. And yet I see her cravings for sugar and hear her express concerns about getting <APO>fat<APO>. I don<APO>t know where she<APO>s getting that from so it<APO>s a concern. She has great models in front of her who are not obsessed with weight, but it<APO>s already starting for her. It<APO>s such a fine balance. I do agree that it needs to be an ongoing conversation and should focus on health and feeling good and not image or even weight. I love MalibuSkipper<APO>s approach with her own child.

I don<APO>t like that, I don<APO>t say it at the moment, but when the kids are away I bring it up to her.

The kids are actually of normal weight, the two little girls are fairly thin and my little brother is of normal weight with a little more meat on him. I<APO>ve noticed that the littlest girl has become too dependent on her eating habits, she<APO>s 5, and whenever she wants to eat something, yogurt, or candy or ice cream, she always asks for permission and if she can have the whole thing.

The pediatrician said she is concerned because his BMI was higher than she would like it to be. We are vegetarians, eat tons of whole grains, fruits and vegetables. He has a very healthy appetite, and eats very well. We don<APO>t do juice, only seltzer, water, and skim milk. She wanted me to start controlling his portion sizes and only let him eat when he is hungry. I am a firm, believer that children don<APO>t generally overeat, they eat until they are full. I<APO>m not concerned about his weight, I think he is going to be a large child. He all ready wears a size 11 W shoe!! Has anyone had any experience with this? Should I be concerned?"
199,64,"BMI 3 year old","Chris Tiongson, MD","2011-09-27 21:37:39","<ORG>","Sounds like you are setting a great example by having lots of healthy meal options at home. Congratulations! To help answer your questions about your son, we need to get an idea of his potential health risk. To do this, docs will use the Body Mass Index percentile, just like we use the growth chart percentiles to give context to the height and weight measurements over time and relative to other kids. Studies of docs relying just on their eyeballs to determine risk based on weight show that we don<APO>t do a good job of picking out kids at risk or potentially at risk as they grow up. So the first step is to make a diagnosis based on BMI percentile for age using the child<APO>s height, weight, gender, and age. Increased risk of health problems is greatest for BMI percentiles greater than the 95%ile for age. There is some increased risk between 85th and 94th%iles as well. I tried to calculate your child<APO>s BMI percentile but I wonder if there is a typo in your child<APO>s height above. 28 3/4\" is more like the height of a 9 month old. Maybe his height is 38 3/4\"? Using the taller height and guessing your son<APO>s age to be 3 yrs and 1 month yields a BMI percentile of 91. This is not the highest risk zone, but something to pay attention to over time since there is a risk of it climbing higher as he grows up. Limiting portion sizes is a useful strategy to encourage healthy eating habits for a lifetime. Hungry kids can always ask for more. Studies of adults show that portion size makes a big difference. The classic popcorn bucket study is a great example. People were given free popcorn at a movie theater. Some people got large buckets and some got small buckets. Guess which group ate more popcorn? The large bucket group. Then the twist. What about giving away stale popcorn? Even when the popcorn wasn<APO>t tasty, the large bucket people still ate more. I think that some (many?) kids, just like adults, are capable of overeating and portion size can be an unconscious trigger to eat more. A typical pattern that I see in my practice is kids who are maybe just a little heavy as preschoolers, then have a steep climb in BMI percentile through early elementary school years to become obese. I don<APO>t know why that happens, but it happens fairly frequently. I think your doctor has probably seen this same phenomenon and was very astute in picking up on a small increase in BMI percentile. Offering some advice at this very early stage can hopefully prevent the BMI percentile from rising higher over the next few years."
200,64,"BMI 3 year old","Lisa_T ","2013-01-15 22:31:41"," Chris Tiongson, MD","Hello! I know this is an older post but I wanted to make a suggestion in case you are still struggling with your son<APO>s weight. Eating a diet rich in grains and low in fat and protein is a high-glycemic diet, which can lead to excess weight gain. Little kids needs lots of good fats and protein to build those growing bodies and to utilize the fat-soluble vitamins and minerals from their diets. I would suggest eating whole-fats in their natural form and cutting out grains as much as possible, focusing on proteins, plants, and healthy fats instead. Eating more fats and protein gives a feeling of satisfaction. Carbs tend to make you want to eat more, and tend to have an addictive quality because of how they affect blood sugar levels. Vegetarian ideas to replace grains are eggs, whole dairy products, and fish, as well as low-glycemic fruits eaten sparingly and lots of vegetables with pastured butter. Cod liver oil and coconut oil given daily can also help make him feel satisfied and help keep his blood sugar and weight stabilized. Eating the protein and fat as the first part of a meal helps keep the blood sugar from spiking, especially if starchy foods are to be eaten. I would suggest trying this, too. I would also suggest reading about diet on Mercola.com or the Weston Price Foundation website. I have learned so much from these sources and they have helped me on my own path to health and wellness.

We first thought it could be an skin allergy, but she didn<APO>t eat anything out of her usually on that day, I believe. Then I remembered that I just purchased her two new pair of jeans for her, she wore one the day before that happened, and the other one on the actual day it happened. The day before she had nothing, but on that day she had a lot of little dots that looked like bruises once she came back from school. Could it be due to the pants maybe being too tight, I asked her if they were too tight and if it hurts, she said is tight, but it didn<APO>t hurt. We will return it tomorrow and get a bigger size just in case. Should we just wait it out and assume it was the pants, or should we still go to the doctor to see if it could be something else. She said it wasn<APO>t itchy and it didn<APO>t hurt. The dots are going away slowly, but I am worried we should maybe make an appointment or go to the E.R. today while is still there to see if it could be something worse. What would you recommend?

It is never easy to make changes and it can be very frustrating when the results don<APO>t seem to match the effort. The next step, which you may have already taken, is to see your doctor for a checkup. That will give you and your doctor a starting point and a better idea of where you are at. A check up can also help your doctor see if there are some complicating health conditions that are making it hard for you to meet your goals. Calculating your BMI and finding out the percentile or ranking, helps determine the level of increased risk of health problems, and thus helps determine how intense your personalized plan should be. After trying the usual things (like healthier eating, increasing physical activity, cutting down sugary drinks, decreasing TV/computer/screen time) then there are other ways to ramp up. Maybe things would be easier with a group of other kids? Sometimes a program over 10 weeks or so that includes some brief classes about cooking healthier, strategies for increasing physical activity in day-to-day activities, exploring what the barriers might be that are making it hard to change. Also, setting up a specific plan for healthy eating with a nutritionist or exercise specialist can give you a specific roadmap to follow. Sometimes it is hard to meet a less defined goal of \"eating better\" or \"exercising more.\" There are different options for kids at top of the charts, percentiles in the 99% range. There are a few very specialized centers around the country that do consider medication or surgery for some kids.

I couldn<APO>t get my son interested in anything outside a game boy or x-box! So as a family we would go roller skating every weekend or every other. Then he would ask to bring his friends along and after a while he was joining the town soccer team. Maybe something you can do with her might spark her interest into doing something fun and active without you, down the road. Skate or hike then a picnic, a bike ride? Good luck!"

If she could eat chicken nuggets and cheeseburgers for every meal she would. She does eat a wide variety of fresh vegetables and fruits, but main dishes are our problem. If I make a pasta dish (even spaghetti and sauce), grilled chicken, pot roast, pork roast or fish, she won<APO>t touch it or even try it! She used to eat and at least try everything. Any suggestions?"

My 8 year old is overweight and has gained more weight this summer. I already cook semi- healthy dinners every night, avoid take out and fast food, limit screen time, and I have her in gymnastics. She is active and rides her bike every day. We don<APO>t have soda in the house, but I do have snack foods (chips, crackers, etc.) I think the snacks are ok in moderation (I don<APO>t want to be a hardliner on sweets and junk food - I<APO>ve seen kids who rebel and go crazy on this when they have the opportunity). But I just read the book Eat This Not That for kids and it<APO>s opened my eyes that what was ok for me growing up may not be ok for kids. So I<APO>m going to make some swaps and if anyone else has tips for healthy kids cooking and packed lunches, I would appreciate it: Caprisun -> swapping to low calorie gatorade White bagels -> mini bagels Cin Toast Crunch -> cheerios or kix Potato Chips -> baked lays Granola bars -> fiber one bars Rice -> couscous (they won<APO>t eat brown or wild) potato-> sweet potato pasta -> ? this is something they love- especially the boxed mac n cheese. they don<APO>t like homemade so can<APO>t do whole grain pasta canned green beans and corn -> lower sodium little debbies -> mini rice crispie treats 1% milk -> skim subs-> wraps lunchables -> make my own with turkey pepperoni, weight watchers string cheese and Kashi crackers Finally, my husband and I eat a lot of main dish salads in summer, but I feel like I go back to the rice/potato/pasta and meat dinners when they<APO>re here. I am going to do big salad night once a week and they<APO>re going to have to deal with it. Any other ideas? I<APO>m hiding the snacks for lunchboxes in my bedroom closet too. Our rule is if you<APO>re hungry eat an apple. Fruit is always allowed."

When I asked what to do, he looked at me and asked if I had done anything to lose weight. After my initial shock, I began to think. Is it correct that my eating habits can impact my son? I have tried several weight loss programs, with little success. I plan to try again if it will help my son. I have considered meal replacement programs but I am not certain if eating different meals than my son will be helpful. I wonder if there are any programs available which will allow me to make changes which I can pass to my son."
